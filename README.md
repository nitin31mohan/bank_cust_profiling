# Profiling and Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

## This project is aimed as a proof of understanding of the K-Means clustering algorithm as well as the need for customer profiling and segmentation in the retail industry --especially, the banking sector

The goal of Profiling is to be able to differentiate between the groups with the proper segregating KPIs and then that cluster is the ideal solution to segment the values.

The steps to perform profiling are as follows:
- Find the count of each segment => gives how many of the observations are present in each of the segments
- Find the `overall average` and the `individual segment-wise average` for each of the attributes
- To find the best profiling (perform steps 1 & 2 for each of the k-values (k = cluster))


## Data

The sample dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. The file is at a customer level with 18 behavioral variables.

KPIs such as:
- Monthly average purchase and cash advance amount 
- Purchases by type (one-off, installments)
- Average amount per purchase and cash advance transaction,
- Limit usage (balance to credit limit ratio),
- Payments to minimum payments ratio etc.
